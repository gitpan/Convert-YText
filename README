NAME
    Convert::YText - Quotes strings suitably for rfc2822 local part

    Convert::YText converts strings to and from "YText", a format inspired
    by xtext defined in RFC1894, the MIME base64 and quoted-printable types
    (RFC 1394). The main goal is encode a UTF8 string into something safe
    for use as the local part in an internet email address (RFC2822).

    By default spaces are replaced with "+", "/" with "~", the
    characters "A-Za-z0-9_.-" encode as themselves, and everything
    else is written "=USTR=" where USTR is the base64 (using
    "A-Za-z0-9_." as digits) encoding of the unicode character
    code. The encoding is configurable; perldoc Convert::YText for
    more information.
